2. How would you modify this function to handle cases where the API response might be missing the age property?
we can modify the return type to account for cases where the age property might be undefined by updating the return type to include age?: number. This indicates that the age property is optional, meaning it might or might not be present in the API response.

modified the function:

typescript
function getUserInfo(userId: number): Promise<{ name: string; age?: number }> {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      return {
        name: data.name,
        age: data.age // This will be undefined if age is not present
      };
    });
}
