To optimize the query in PostgreSQL, indexing the tables correctly is crucial for improving query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Here's how I would approach indexing:

1. Composite Index on orders(user_id, order_date)
The query filters on order_date to fetch orders from the last month and groups the data by user_id.
By creating a composite index on user_id and order_date, PostgreSQL can efficiently retrieve the relevant records based on both the user and the date range.
The order of columns in the index matters. Since the query filters first by order_date and then groups by user_id, this index will make the filtering and grouping steps faster.

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);
How it helps:
It speeds up the JOIN operation, where orders are matched to users based on user_id.
The index also allows efficient range filtering (order_date) and is useful when the database has many entries spanning over months or years.

2. Primary Key or Unique Index on users(user_id)
The user_id column in the users table should be the primary key or at least have a unique index if it's not already the primary key.
This ensures efficient lookups and joins between the users and orders tables, where user_id is the common field.

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_user_id ON users(user_id);
How it helps:
It ensures that lookups on the users table (during the join operation) are fast and efficient since user_id will be indexed and unique.

3. Index on orders(amount) (optional)
Although summing up the amount column is a lightweight operation, creating an index on amount can help PostgreSQL optimize aggregations.
However, this index is less critical than the composite index on user_id and order_date, as aggregations typically benefit more from well-optimized filtering and joining.

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_amount ON orders(amount);
How it helps:
Speeds up the SUM(o.amount) operation in cases where there are frequent aggregations across a large number of orders.
